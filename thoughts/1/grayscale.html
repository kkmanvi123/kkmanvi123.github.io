    <p>I must’ve been around ten when my parents finally let me customize the room my brother and I shared — a long-awaited upgrade from the bland, builder-grade beige walls we’d lived with for years. I already had a vision: bold red stripes, stacked in varying thicknesses, something that felt loud.</p>

    <p>We walked into our neighborhood Home Depot, my small hand tucked into one of theirs, and made a beeline for the Behr paint section. I remember standing in front of the massive wall of paint chips — hundreds of them, perfectly arranged in a rainbow of tiny rectangles.</p>

    <p class="italic">*Where do I even start?*</p>

    <p>I glanced at the reds for maybe two minutes before something shifted. I started grabbing every color that called to me — pastels, rich maroons (a forever favorite), and deep greens. By the time my mom circled back to check in, I looked down at my hands, expecting to narrow in on a few red options.</p>

    <p>Instead, I was holding a stack of over 50 paint chips. Not a single one was red.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Years later, I found myself back in that same Home Depot, standing in front of that same Behr wall — but this time, I walked straight to the grays. No wandering, no impulse grabs. I picked a shade that felt safe. Neutral. Easy to match. Not too bold, not too bright.</p>

    <p>This quiet transition from chasing color to settling into grayscale didn't stop at my bedroom walls. It gradually seeped into other parts of my life — my wardrobe, my furniture choices, even the art on my walls. The vibrant, curious child who once collected fifty colorful paint chips had somehow transformed into an adult who instinctively reached for "safe" options.</p>

    <p>And honestly, I didn't think much of it—until this year, when I realized my personal shift was not merely personal.</p>

    <h2>A Global Shift</h2>

    <p>I’ve spent some time thinking about what’s made us collectively step away from color. It can’t just be about preference — humans are <em>meant</em> to love color. Our ability to remember, perceive, and resonate is shaped by bold, distinguishable design — <strong>not</strong> monotony.</p>

    <p>The modern obsession with efficiency and mass production has pushed us headfirst into minimalism and ‘sleek’ design. We’ve shifted into a global marketplace that’s watered down craftsmanship and culture-specific design, replacing it with cheaper, more scalable material like plastics.</p>

    <p>Homogeneity has given way to more standardized, controlled use of color. Design that reflected local art, tradition, and culture was the norm, but has become a marker of status. Incorporating those custom, character-rich elements is now tied to wealth, making them feel out of reach for most people.</p>

    <h2>One Step Further</h2>

    <p>This goes beyond just color. The push for universally palatable design permeates everything around us — in the apps we use, the brands we follow, the spaces we live in. Logos have been stripped down to near-identical sans-serif typefaces, losing the little quirks that once made each brand feel like its own.</p>

    <p>This visual homogenization extends to our entertainment as well. Compare films from the 1990s and early 2000s with today's major releases. Earlier decades embraced distinctive color palettes that helped tell their stories — think of <em>Amélie</em>'s saturated greens and reds, or Wes Anderson's meticulously curated color schemes. Now, scroll through any streaming platform and you'll notice a prevailing aesthetic: a color-gradedness that appears deliberately muted and moody.</p>

    <p><strong>Digital scannability now takes precedence over human-centered design.</strong> Interfaces are created to be processed efficiently rather than experienced deeply. <em>Has the novelty of color simply worn off? Or have we been conditioned to accept this visual neutrality as a hallmark of sophistication?</em></p>

    <p>Whatever the answer, this homogeneity is no longer just a passing trend—it has quietly become the default.</p>

    <h2>A Reflection</h2>

    <p>I sometimes stare at the gray walls of my bedroom and wonder how I got here. That ten-year-old with fifty colorful paint chips clutched in her hand feels like someone else entirely. <em>Why did I start choosing safety over vibrancy?</em></p>

    <p>Maybe this is why we're all so drawn to our phones. The world around us has faded to grayscale, but our screens still pulse with color. One click and I’m in my camera roll — a gallery of vivid moments, often enhanced to be brighter than they really were. We’ve built digital worlds more colorful than the physical ones we live in.</p>

    <p>I've been thinking about that disconnect. <em>What would shift if we reversed this relationship? If instead of obsessing over how things appear, we started paying closer attention to how they make us feel?</em></p>

    <p>Lately, I’ve found myself drawn to objects with history and character — things that feel like they have a story. My latest fixation is finding the perfect vintage gramophone, not because it’s the most efficient way to listen to music, but because it has soul. It turns the act of listening into something intentional again.</p>

    <p>I keep returning to this line from <em>The Creative Act</em>: “The closer we get to our own voice, the more the work resonates with others. The more personal it is, the more universal it becomes.” That feels important. In a world where everything is designed to be neutral and inoffensive, there’s something quietly radical about choosing character over convenience.</p>

    <p>We can all take small steps in that direction. Choosing the bold red stripe instead of the safe gray. Seeking out pieces with soul instead of the ones that match everything. Creating spaces that reflect who we are, not just what’s trending. Because I worry we’re drifting from the very things that make us human — the quirks that inspire curiosity and allow us to resonate.</p>
